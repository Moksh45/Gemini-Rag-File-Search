I, Claudius

Robert Graves' masterpiece, "I, Claudius," is a historical novel set in ancient Rome that tells the life story of the Roman Emperor Claudius through his own perspective. Published in 1934, the novel has become a classic of English literature.

The narrative begins with Claudius recounting his life story, starting from his childhood during the reign of Augustus. Claudius was considered by many to be an idiot or fool due to his physical disabilities, which included a limp and a stammer. However, this perception masks his keen intelligence and careful observation of the political machinations of the imperial court.

Throughout the novel, Graves weaves together historical events with the personal drama of the imperial family. Claudius witnesses the reigns of several emperors including Tiberius, Caligula, and eventually becomes emperor himself. The work provides insights into the various intrigues, murders, and power struggles that defined the early Roman Empire.

One of the key themes in the novel is how those considered weak or disabled can possess hidden strengths and wisdom. Claudius's apparent foolishness actually protects him during dangerous times, as the more powerful members of the imperial family overlook him while they pursue power.

The novel combines fictional dramatization with historical facts about the Roman emperors and their courts. Graves bases his narrative on historical sources while filling in gaps with plausible fictional scenarios that bring the characters to life.
